# Implement liveliness, readiness and startup probes

## Status

approved

## Context

Cloud providers often rely on the usage of Orchestration systems
over a containerization technology.

The orchestration system needs to know at least 2 things about any service:
* If the service started correctly after a deploy
* If the service is still healthy at any moment in time

## Decision

When implementing an API that has to be deployed on the cloud,
implement the following endpoints:
* `/ready` an endpoint that returns a 200 - OK if the service is ready to
accept requests after a new deploy
* `/health` an endpoint that returns a 200 - OK if the service is still alive
and functioning correctly


## Consequences

Thanks to this 2 endpoints is possible to deterministically and automatically
detect problems both after a new deployment and during the normal operation 
of the service directly into the orchestration service.
